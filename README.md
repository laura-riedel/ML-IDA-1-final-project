The dataset describes diagnosing of cardiac Single Proton Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) images. Each of the patients is classified into two categories: normal (1) and abnormal (0). The training data contains 80 SPECT images from which 22 binary features have been extracted. The goal is to predict the label for an unseen test set of 187 tomography images.
